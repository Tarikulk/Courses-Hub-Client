# At first.  i created router for that i have used router in different components. Then i form my project component structure and create my folder. I have linked routes to components. I have created a nav router.

# Second .  i have created fake data in another server and load this in my client site server. Then i have show those fake API's data in my UI for that at first i was created a side navbar for course details . In  side navbar i have showed category detail's route and also i have showed side navbar as card in the outlet. 

# Third .  i have loaded my second API which are containing Course Details and i have showed course details form that fake API. I have linked course category to course details so that i could go course details page by clicking single course category route. 

# Fourth . i have use my last API which are containing premium course details . But there have an another route to go the premium course. For that i have create a private route which give permission user to go premium access if user is login and user have to purchased on that route. 

# Fifth . After that i have showed premium access route and there have some premium course details. 

Others: I have used some addition technologies for design and user better experience like React Toastify, AOS which make ui more beautiful and comfortable.
